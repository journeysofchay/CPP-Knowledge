Most Cross-Platform:

+ Clang: Clang is a popular open-source compiler known for its portability and support for various architectures and operating systems. It can compile C++ code for Windows, Linux, macOS, and other platforms.

+ GCC (GNU Compiler Collection): GCC is another widely used open-source compiler suite with excellent cross-platform support. It can target a vast array of platforms similar to Clang.



Note about LLVM:

LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine, though the name is no longer an acronym) itself isn't a complete C++ compiler in the traditional sense. It's a compiler infrastructure project that provides a collection of tools and libraries used in building compilers.

Here's how LLVM fits into the picture:

Both Clang and GCC, the top compilers on the list for cross-platform support, utilize LLVM as a core component. LLVM provides them with an intermediate representation (IR) for the compiled code, which acts as a portable assembly language. This IR can be optimized and then translated into machine code for specific target platforms.
So, while LLVM isn't directly on the list of compilers, it plays a crucial role behind the scenes in enabling the cross-platform capabilities of Clang and GCC.
